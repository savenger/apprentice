# The Apprentice
A young sorcerer apprentice is left alone in his masters house. It is a chilly night, so he tries to make a fire in the fireplace. Unfortunately, the spell backfires and a portal opens in the fireplace, spawning fire wraiths. Armed with his four element spells: Fire (Fire projectiles), Ice (Ice Projectiles), Air (Knockback) and Earth (Earth wall), he tries to ward off the danger.
